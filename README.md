# Bubble Bobble Bonkers #
It may not be the real game ....   
But why not play my memory game & find some of the characters,
While listening to the classic retro theme tune :)

## Project Goals

To create a fun & interactive environment for the user, where they can 'chill out' & play a memory game based on an absolute 80's classic.
Test your memory, speed & interactive skills to match the characters & gameplay objects on hidden cards, within an allotted time (depending on level).
My bro & I played Bubble Bobble for hours on end because it was so awesomely addictive which is what I want my game to be as well. 
Although my game ain't the real deal, I still want users / players to feel that retro nostaglia when they play it & fall in love with Bub & Bob, the main Bubble Bobble characters.
And for an added touch, you will get to hear the unforgettable theme tune while you compete against the clock :)
