# Bubble Bobble Bonkers #
This may not be the real Bubble Bobble but ....   
Why not play my wee memory game & find some of the characters,  
While listening to the classic retro theme tune :)

## Project Goals

There isn't a day goes by when someone in the world needs a wee timeout from their normal, boring & monotonous day to day activities.....
If only they had some kind of game to entertain themselves with & therefore flush their life stresses down the porcelain gateway to extinction :)
Hold my coffee .... That's were Bubble Bobble Bonkers will come to the rescue & save their day !

My aim is to create a fun & interactive environment for the user, where they can 'chill out' & play a memory game based on an absolute 80's classic.
Test your memory, speed & interactive skills to match the characters & gameplay objects on hidden cards, within an allotted time (depending on level).
My bro & I played the original Bubble Bobble game for hours on end because it was so awesomely addictive which is what I want my game to be as well. 
Although my game ain't the real deal, I still want users / players to feel that retro nostaglia when they play it & fall in love with Bub & Bob, the main Bubble Bobble characters.
And for an added touch, you will get to hear the unforgettable Bubble Bobble theme tune while you play each level :)

## User Goals

* Have some awesome fun & a smile whilst doing so
* Interact with the Bub & Bob (user has to input name for this)
* Play an cool 80s classic based interactive game
* Enjoy the game so much they want to come back to play again & again & again ha ha
* Possible message form (add link from game) - for any bugs or issues with the game or possible future ideas
* Tell their friends about this awesome retro memory game

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to take some time out from my daily routine & play a wee game
* As a user, I want to be able to play a sneaky wee game on my office desktop, on my tablet in the bath & on my mobile whilst commuting home ... obviously when NOT driving a car!
* As a user, I want to be able to score points for matching cards / tiles
* As a user, I want the game to get more difficult as I progress
* As a user, I want to be able to compete against my current high score
* As a user, I want to let the developer know if there are any gameplay bugs so they can rectify them or level difficulty suggestions for future updates
* As a user, I want to enjoy a aesthetically pleasing game which is easy to navigate around 
* As a user, I want to feel that I have a friend on the other side of the screen .... awwww !

## Site Owner Goals

* As a site owner, I want to make sure game players smile & laugh
* As a site owner, I want them to connect and love the characters that is Bub & Bob
* As a site owner, I want visitors to have fun playing a cool, yet challenging game
* As a site owner, I want people to enjoy the catchy & unforgettable theme tune from the orginal Bubble Bobble
* As a site owner, I want gamers to actually go out & buy the orginal Bubble Booble so they can play iy with their friends because it was sooooo good back in the day & even to this day
* As a site owner, I want set up a contact form for users to declare any bugs or issues with the game for me to rectify & any possible ideas
* As a site owner, I want people to enjoy themselves that much that they want to come back for more (maybe even beat their last highest score)

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements 

* Single page game with introduction page 
* Allow player to input their actual name so that it will increase their feeling of game involvement & therefore their interactivity with the game
* Fun looking website which is aesthetically pleasing also
* Easy & smooth interaction with the game play
* Increased difficulty either by shortening the game countdown timer or by adding extra memory tiles to turn over
* The classic Bubble Bobble theme tune has to be playing in the background for sure
* Once tiles have been matched, increase the players score (possibly decrease score on a mismatch in a later level)
* To have link to a contact form for unnoticed bugs & ideas (obviously I don't want any bug feedback tbh but may add form just in case)

### Expectations

* The user will smile as a bare minimum if I consider my wee game a success
* They will enjoy the website layout and navigate freely with no issues
* A good working game (but I do foresee some hidden bugs tbh, which may be undetected unless you play the game over & over & over), hence the contact form
* I'm hoping for feeling of addictiveness (in a good way) which will bring the user back for more
* Stimulation of the human nation
* Some crazy fun .... for sure !

## Design Choices

I will be using Bootstrap 4 to create the overall layout of my game, as this will make it easier for me to control it's functionality across multiple devices.
As for the actual game design, it will be pretty simple as it's going to be a single page that hosts the game.
I will have an introduction page so the user can input a game name for that personal interactive feeling & possible rules of the game / level, if required.
For the main gameplay area, I was thinking of using one of the actual original game levels & then add my game memory tiles to it. 
The main opening game screens & a lot of the levels were very dense with actual gameplay content if I remember right so I need to find an appropiate level
that will allow me the space to add my memory tiles. I know it's a bit hazy at the minute but once I start to delve into screen plays & game levels, we will find a suitable back drop
for this awesome memory game :)

### Fonts

For my fonts, I'm looking at deffo going retro on this one because the original game came out in 1986, therefore I want to try & keep to that basic style. 
Also, because it's Bubble Bobble based there will definintely be some 'Bubble' writing throughout. I have located similar Bubble fonts online & 
I am currently checking for retro fonts that will work too. I can see that Bitmap fonts are the oldskool retro gaming fonts that were used back in the day.
Fontspace looks like an awesome website with all these cool fonts that might be useful for this project.
I have settled on [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) for the main Intro font & [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) for the main Game font. I think the both work really well.

### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require, as always. 
I also plan to use some of the retro characters or gameplay objects from Bubble Bobble to use as icons, if applicable.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the game layout perfectly.
As my game developed I realised I needed a few fonts. The first one was the <b>mute</b> and <b>unmute</b> icons, that when the mute button is pressed
they swap, using Javascript. The next icon was the <b>home</b> one which is used to take you from the Gamezone to the Intro.
I then added the <b>star</b> and <b>cog</b> icons for opening up High Scores (with reset button) and Rule junmbotrons.
Again, I think the icons fit really well with the button colours & the pages.

### Colours

If the truth be told, this was quite a hard choice because of the fact it's a game & not an actual website.
Therefore to keep inline with the original game itself, I used a website called [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to upload the main Bubble Bobble title.
Once the image was uploaded I was able to select the main colours from it & get the HEX values. 
I also had blue (for Bob), green (for Bub) & orange (the outline of the cloud) selected but I had to cut unfortunately. 
So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***White***           |#FFFFFF    |White              |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Aureolin***        |#FEEE20    |Loud Yellow        |Titles & text                   |
|***Rose Bonbon***     |#F74498    |Bubblegum Pink     |Titles & text                   |
|***Black***           |#000000    |Black              |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

# Wireframes
---
The software that I used for my **wireframes** was [***Balsamiq***](https://balsamiq.com/).
This was the second time I used this software & it was deffo a lot easier to understand what you need to do. 
The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile.
They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are:)  

My wireframes are set out where you will first have a wee intro screen to input your ***game name*** & get your self fully prepared for the game of your life :)
The second screen will basically be the gamezone & pretty much the same for the 3 levels as well, maybe with different backgrounds or slight tweaks.
I have added an **alternative gamezone wireframe** for my desktop because I am still unsure at what layout will work better & look more aesthetically pleasing.
At present, as I write this, I am swaying more towards the *alternative* version but even this coould change as I progress ha ha!

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

- [Mobile Intro Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/mobile-intro-wireframe.pdf)
- [Mobile Gamezone Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/mobile-gamezone-wireframe.pdf)

- [Tablet Intro Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/tablet-intro-wireframe.pdf)
- [Tablet Gamezone Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/tablet-gamezone-wireframe.pdf)

- [Desktop Intro Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/desktop-intro-wireframe.pdf)
- [Desktop Gamezone Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/desktop-gamezone-wireframe.pdf)
- [Desktop Gamezone Alternative Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/BubbleBobbleBonkers/raw/master/wireframes/desktop-gamezone-alt-wireframe.pdf)


Hopefully, I can pull this off & do wee Bob & wee Bub some justice with my memory game. 
To be honest I can't wait to hear the wee theme tune as I match those cards.


### What didn't make the cut

Possible high score register for user to compete against (can also be reset by user)

# Testing

### **Take A Wee Break**

#### User Story : I want to take some time out from my daily routine & play a wee game

* **Plan**
Create a fun memory game that will allow the user to escape from normal life, even for a few moments.
I am going to base my memory game on a retro 80s classic arcade game so I will utilise as much Bubble Bobble content as I can.
I will use the various characters for my hidden memory cards so it will all look awesome & retro.
I hope to add the wee theme tune as well because it will just add to the overall retro feel of the game .... de de dee de de de dee (don't worry you'll be dee deeing it too soon enough ha ha)

* **Implementation**

I set out to make a simple wee memory game and if I completed eveything as mentioned in the plan, I would be happy enough.
Well I did this and have now been waking up at 3 o'clock in the morning de deeing the fecking theme tune !
Only messing, I did want a cool retro looking game & I feel I have pulled it off.
At the start I gathered as much info, pictures, images, game sprites, audio, as I could .... I even got screenshots of every level from the original game.
I actually used round87 where I edited out some other background detail to give me the open space for my game design.
I amended the Bubble Bobble image for my main headings in Paint 3D by adding a 3D Bonkers using my main pink colour.
I got an image with all the main Bubble Bobble characters on it & edited this to remove each character separately.
I centered each image and resized them to 200px by 200px for my card characters.
I also utilised the Bub and Bob characters for the comedy chat on the Intro.
As regards the buttons, I decided on them as I went along.




* **Test**

I have tested this game so many times myself and deep down I still really love it ha ha ... I think it's an awesome wee game considering I only learnt Javascript
about 2 months ago and only started developing the game a month ago.
It's a simple wee game which gets harder each level by the fact it removes 10 second from the previous time.
It stores your high score so you can try and beat it everytime.
I try to be interactive with the user by getting their Game Name and using it where possible to involve them in the intro chat & game play messages.
Aesthetically it looks really good & the audio works well at each instance is used. These are the orginal audio clips from the orignal Bubble Bobble too.

I shared my link with a few lads and lasses at work breaktime, so they could be my testers .... they all loved it and said it was super addictive !
Especially when I said that if you complete the last level .... you become a <b>Legend !</b> ha ha .... should have seen their wee fingers tapping cards like mad :)
Anyways, I came back for lunch and as I walked in the canteen ... all you heard was the wee Bubble Bobble theme tune blasting out from several different phones.
Not gonna lie ... that was one of the best feelings that I have ever felt, in a long long time :)
My boss text me at like 9 that night saying he was a Legend so he must've been playing it ... love it ha ha !
I got them to test everything within the game, I got them to fill out a questionnaire that I made and also add their device / operating systems too.
 
Unfortunately, the biggest bug I came across and I will talk about later within my <b>Bug Section</b> was the fact that the game doesn't work on iOS operating system device and therefore Safari .... I was truely gutted when I found this out from my Mentor because whilst it looked really cool to me, his would not display the characters when the cards turned. He has a Mac by the way. That near broke me as it was os unexpected but I will explain leter as said already.

* **Result**

Overall, the game works really well and give the user more than I expected it to. It's aesthetically pleasing, has a catchy backdrop with catchy music.
It is slightly addictive which is what I had anticapated at the start and secretly aimed for.
The overall layout looks awesome and I am super happy with how it looks overall.
The cards turn when pressed, they lock when matched, the score adds up, the time counts down. When the timer gets to 10 seconds the timer starts to flash
and I changed the music to the faster sounding version .... talk about the heart beating faster when them two actions happen, gets the adrenilin going that wee combo does :)
It's deffo easy the first couple of levels but the last level is quite tough to be fair but if you really want that <b>Legendary Status</b> ... it has to be completed.
Obviously, there is always room for improvement and I already have some thoughts on these in the <b>Features</b> section.

* **Verdict**

I'm very happy with the end result, the game is interactive and works really well.
Anyone that has played it, gave me awesome feedback and said they would deffo play it again.
It deffo takes you away from your normal life for a few monents, if not hours ha ha but this was what I wanted in the plan :)
I actually can't wait until I finish this course and get back to maybe extending it further with a few harder upgrades.

### **Multiple Device Play**

#### User Story : I want to be able to play a sneaky wee game on my office desktop, on my tablet in the bath & on my mobile whilst commuting home ... obviously when NOT driving a car!

* **Plan**    
I want the user to be able to play my game on any device they want or choose. Therefore the game layout will have to be compatible on large desktop screens, 
right through to small mobile screens. I will achieve this by using the Bootstrap framework (Ver 4) as the foundation from where to build my game up. 
I am a bit more clued up on Bootstrap now but deffo struggled a little on my first project with it. 
This time I will start with the mobile design (seeing it is a mobile first framework) & work my way up, to the desktop sized screens.
On a mobile device, you are really limited to the maximum number of tile / cards that can be displayed due to the screen size but I have settled for 12 max.
I may increase the maximum tile numbers as the screen size gets larger but we will have to see.

* **Implementation**

I used the Code Institute Github template as I know these had all that I required to build my game up.
I utilsed Bootstrap for most of my layout and used CSS grid-container class for my cards whcih I got from w3schools.
In hindsight, I should have used my alternative wireframe design for landscape view but I will deffo fix this at a later date.
These bugs and issues are what make you stronger as a coder I feel and it is such a steep learning curve at the start


* **Test**

This game is really only designed for <b>Portrait View</b> and I will look at making it work better on <b>Landscape View</b> at a later date.
I have to be honest, I only noticed the extent of the landscape mode issue when I had the users test it.
I had always looked at my game in portrait mode using <b>Chrome Dev Tools</b> and responsive mode but it never dawned on me that it would become 
overlapping on screens where the width is larger than the height.
This was my second major frustration, just behind the iOS Safari issue, but something I will fix in the future for sure and I will remember this for future projects.

On large screened desktops, large screened laptops the game will still work, it's just the smaller screens is where it becomes crammed.
On tablets / mobiles and in portrait view, I think it looks really cool especially the Gamezone.
I checked on my devices, I checked on my wee testers devices and all looked really well ... visually.



* **Result**

Overall, it has worked on any Android mobile I've seen and any Android tablet, as long as they are in portrait view.
I used Dev Tools to view it across their selections of mobile and tablet views, again in portrait view, and they all looked good.
I use Chrome and on my large screen it looks fine in landscape view. It's the same on FireFox.
I never increased the number of cards on display as I was limited for time but this is another future feature that can be implemented.

* **Verdict**

The tests wokred perfect for portrait views but need landscape view on smaller devices fixed at a future date.

### **Score Points**

#### User Story : I want to be able to score points for matching cards / tiles

* **Plan**  
My aim is to add 5 points for a match & subtract 2 points for a mismatch. I will write some JS code that will incorporate some mathematical equations.
If my cards match function is true, then I'll add a score of 5 to the users total score, if it's a mismatch (else if), I'll subtract 2 points from the users total score.
I hope this code is as simple to write, as it is to say it ha ha ! 


* **Implementation**

I first created my various cards functions like shuffle, display, etc,etc.
And obviously two functions for when a match happens <b>cardsMatch()</b> and when a match doesn't happen <b>cardsDontMatch()</b>.
I simply added <b>points += 5;</b> to the cardsMatch function and <b>points -= 2;</b> to the cardsDontMatch function.
I declared the points variable at the start by making it zero.
After each line above I then wrote the points total to the score span HTML and it displays the users changing score as you play the game.
This was relatively easy once I had the main card action functions completed.



* **Test**

I have tested this on various devices and various different browsers and had no issues of the score adding or taking away from the level total.
When you turn over two cards and they do not match, the users score decrease by 2 points (-2 pts).
When you turn two cards over and they do match, the users score increases by 5 points (+5 pts).


* **Result**

The code works well an I am happy that it did

* **Verdict**

My plan was successfully completed for the User to score points whether the cards match or not. 


### **Level Difficulty**

#### User Story : I want the game to get more difficult as I progress

* **Plan**  
My plan is to design at least 3 levels with the first one being the easiest & the last one being the hardest .... standard gaming etiquette to be fair.
The first level will have max 12 tiles & you just compete at your own pace.
The second level will have max 12 tiles but you will have a time of 60 seconds to complete all the matches.
The third level will have again 12 tiles but the time will either be 40 or 50 seconds now. I will decide when testing to see how difficult either is.


* **Implementation**

* **Test**

* **Result**

* **Verdict**


### **Current Players High Score**

#### User Story : I want to be able to compete against my current high score

* **Plan**  
I will store the score after each game in a variable. I will then display that on the screen at each level.
So the user has a goal for each game he or she plays. Just a wee added incentive to keep playing :)

* **Implementation**

* **Test**

* **Result**

* **Verdict**


### **Contact Form**

#### User Story : I want to let the developer know if there are any gameplay bugs so they can rectify them or level difficulty suggestions for future updates

* **Plan**  
I want to add a contact form so that the user can contact me if they come across any bugs that I may have missed with the game.
They could also suggest various ways to increase level difficulty for future level expansion. 
While I will test this as best as I can & ask family, friends & work colleagues to test my user stories .... I still forsee some bugs with it.
So I think a wee contact form will help keep the game bug free & help me as a developer too.

* **Implementation**

* **Test**

* **Result**

* **Verdict**


### **Game Navagation & Interaction**

#### User Story : I want to enjoy a aesthetically pleasing game which is easy to navigate around

* **Plan**  
I am going to build this on mobile first as I know this will be the most difficult due to size restrictions.
I want to have a smooth flowing game that the user can play over & over again. 
As I progress through the screen sizes, I can add more content to make it look more retro.
The tiles will turn on touch, hold, then turn back unless there has been a match.
I want this movement to be easy on the eye & look awesomely animated.
Nice vibrant colours based on the original game will hopefully make it fun & indulging.

* **Implementation**

* **Test**

* **Result**

* **Verdict**


### **Be A Friend Of Bob & Bub**

#### User Story : I want to feel that I have a friend or friends on the other side of the screen .... awwww !

* **Plan**  
Create an introduction page that welcomes the user & asks them to input their game name. I will store this as a variable & use it to allow that feeling of loving interaction :)
I want the user to feel welcome anytime & maybe feel a little nostalgic, if they were born in the 70s, as the 80s would've been the start of the arcade gaming world. 
The chances are the user played the original Bubble Bobble so a flood of childhood memories could come flowing back ..... it's all about the memories :)  
I also want the user to feel they are interacting with Bob & Bub by adding good vibes comments but using their game name too .... to address them. 

* **Implementation**

When writing up the functions I found that I could remove some js by adding a '0' to my high-score spans, in my html .... D'OH !
instead of using innerHTML = `0`; everytime :)



* **Test**

* **Result**

* **Verdict**



# Bugs
---
  
Added some speech bubble code but I wanted to add some code on a click of the button. The speech bubble was always there even before the click.
So I added the speech bubble css class to my JS literal thingy for using when called for.S


When my comedy chat between Bub & Bob starts but the user wants to change their username then Bub will reset okay but Bob & his speech bubble are still there.
I added two lines of code to the user name input button function which will remove any innerHTML first from the Bob image Div & his speech bubble div.

document.getElementById("bob-talk").innerHTML = "";     // Added these two lines so it will remove Bob & his speech bubble if they enter a new username
document.getElementById("bob-position").innerHTML = "";


Not a bug - But used my first shorthand padding utility class to allow me to reduce CSS code as I had intro 1 & intro 2.
Both pretty much the same but one had 1rem of padding in addition so I put padding shorthand class in DOM & removed padding in CSS.
I then removed intro 2 & changed the html classes appropiately to all match intro 1.


Was using a line of code to clear Game Name input on first bub hit but then I loose the user name variable for th erst of my comedy chat


Game Name input was responsive until after 991px then it just went small in length. I was using the form-group class to set max-width to 30rem.
Tried a few things but eventually found that if I used the lower div class of input-group to set my max-width then it stayed responsive across all screen sizes.


Trying to get the username (Game Name) variable to transfer from index.html to gamezone.html was a complete nightmare for ma ha ha.
I spent about 3 hopurs on this one but got there in the end.
I used the Session Storage method to do this which I got from this link https://code-boxx.com/pass-variables-between-pages-javascript/
I could see the variable in Dev Tools in the application section after the button was hit but couldn't get it to display on my gamezone page.
Basically it was non matching variable names & syntax errors but I got there in the end ..... now I am a JavaScript Jedi .... NOT !!!!

Cards would turn but the you could turn another one then another one which messed up the sequence. I added the gridLock logic to stop this from happening.
Only two cards can be turned now & the sequence stays functional.

Thought I had an issue with getting images to populate the grid with some images not loading on occassions
kept testing the restart over & over again to try figure the issue out. Fount that it was only two images that din't load on occassions
Looked further using Dev Tools & found that it was the same image & it's duplicate.
Checked the code out & found I had typed 'scr' instead of 'src'...... slap to the face for me !


Wanted some sort of alert for when the time was running out so added a function but couldn't get it to work.
Investigated animation & keyframes. Added some animation / keyframe code to my css.
Added one line of code to my 60 sec timer so that on 10 sec it would add my flash class to my time class list & therefore flashing the game timer :)


Media Queries wouldn't work once it went below 1200px - must have deleted the last '}' of the largest media query which fucked it all up ffs :()


During Mentor session when he was playing my game the face card image showed up reversed when the card turned & no character image was displayed :( I could have cried tbh!
On my screen / PC it worked perfectly. I was windows & he was Mac so I need to figure this out. I am running Chrome plus I checked it on Firefox & my andoid phone.
All worked perfectly for me.
On firefox though the theme tune would not autoplay either :(  .... gonna cry soon !!!
https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backface-visibility/ - backface visibility seems to be the issue I think & hope !


Tried for hours on end to get Countdown timer to reduce as I levelled up but obviously when the game reloaded the countdown timer also reset to 60.
I utilised localstorage again to store the level & count down time. I wrote some code that when the level up button was presssed it increased the level variable by 1 & stored it in local storage.
In my level up function check the lavel value & therefore set the countdown time accordingly (the higher the level the less time you have).
This one busted my balls for sure but I am nearly there at this momemnt in time.
I also added some code to my restart function (when game times out) which resets these two variables to level 1 i.e. counDown = 60 seconds & level = 1 so the user can start from the beginning again.




couldn't get switch function to work for calculating level scores.
I needed a '+' at the start of my switch expression which was levelAt.
I didn't need this for gameChat function where I used the totalCards value to switch messages to be displayed. 
So this confused the hell out of me ffs.



couldn't get high scores to reset properly using remove local storage so just had to put the 5 level hi =gh scores to zero when reset button pressed

Could't figure out why when you refreshed the page and started the gamezone that it still said null when dispalying the current high score
I thought I was zeroing the high scores within my checkHiScore function but I was only zeroing the High Score Jumbotron innerHTML for display purposes only.
Once I realise this mistake I added 'localStorage.setItem("Level1HiScore", 0);' for each level which zero's the high scores only if the value was orginally 'null'.
The function allows for current level high score to be kept & displayed to the jumbotron.
I also added the checkHiScore function on start up so everything is in place :) 

score calculations .... the time left when level was completed did not match my 'time left' on the console log (it was 1 second out every time)

Took on any critique from my first project so hopefully I have ironed out the issues from it :)

I've added some adult humour for the purposes of having a laugh but obviously if this was going to be seen by children I would remove it & keep it clean

CONCLUSION

I feel taht I achieved so much with my wee game. I have had my ups and downs trying to work with Javascript
I really love what it does and I know that my code can be simplified much better and neater but the more I learn, the better I'll become.
I had never dealt with Javascript before the start of March so to produce what I have for this project has made me even more determined to succeed.
My game works the way I wanted it too and I 98% of the time enjoyed everything about designing it to building it.
The 2% was for my iOS Safari bug and my landscape view which really hurt because I was not expecting them.
